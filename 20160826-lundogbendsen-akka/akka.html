# Concurrency models

- Threads and locks
- Futures and callbacks
- Actor model
- Reactive streams

- Java examples

---

# Parallellism

- Actually run several units of work simultaneously

--

# Concurrency

- Logically run several units of work, seemingly in parallel

---

Threads and mutexes

- *Thread* : logical thread of execution, scheduled by OS scheduler
- All threads share one memory space
- *Mutex* : _mutually exclusive_ flag that prevents threads from accessing shared resources

--

Advantages
- Close to how the hardware actually works
- The only model generally tought in school
- Blocking on I/O natually equivalent to "this, then this"

Disadvantages
- Expensive (~1M stack)
- Slow to create/destroy
- Deadlock

---

# Futures and callbacks

- Asynchronous operation returns an object that _eventually_ yields a result
  - Scala, Finagle, Q.js, ... : Promise / Future
  - Java 8: CompletionStage / CompletableFuture
- Can be chained, causing further processing (and further futures) after a stage 
  completes
- Can be merged, waiting for several futures' results before commencing 

Advantages
- Simple to grasp

Disadvantages
- "callback hell"
- no backpressure
- not (easily) cancellable
- still needs locking (unless using a single thread)

---

# Cores and caches

- Latency Comparison Numbers

    L1 cache reference                           0.5 ns
    Branch mispredict                            5   ns
    L2 cache reference                           7   ns
    Mutex lock/unlock                           25   ns
    Main memory reference                      100   ns
    Compress 1K bytes with Zippy             3,000   ns
    Context switch                          10,000   ns (if working set in L2)
    Send 1K bytes over 1 Gbps network       10,000   ns
    Context switch                        >100,000   ns (bigger working set)
    Read 4K randomly from SSD*             150,000   ns
    Read 1 MB sequentially from memory     250,000   ns
    Round trip within same datacenter      500,000   ns
    Read 1 MB sequentially from SSD*     1,000,000   ns
    Disk seek                           10,000,000   ns
    Read 1 MB sequentially from disk    20,000,000   ns
    Send packet CA->Netherlands->CA    150,000,000   ns

- Keep working on the same data for as long as possible

# The actor model

- *Actor* is an entity that responds only to messages by
  - sending messages to other actors
  - creating other, child, actors
  - adjusting its behaviour

- *Akka* is a toolkit for writing actors in Java
  - Actor is a normal Java class that extends `UntypedActor` or `AbstractActor`

- *Message* is an immutable, serializable, Java class

---

# Actor ping pong 

```java
public class PingActor extends UntypedActor {

    private int counter = 0;
    private ActorRef pongActor = getContext().actorOf(Props.create(PongActor.class), "pongActor");

    public void onReceive(Object message) throws Exception {
        if (message instanceof Initialize) {
            log.info("In PingActor - starting ping-pong");
            pongActor.tell("ping", getSelf());
        } else if (message instanceof String) {
            log.info("In PingActor - received message: {}", message);
            counter += 1;
            if (counter == 3) {
                getContext().system().shutdown();
            } else {
                getSender().tell("ping", getSelf());
            }
        } else {
            unhandled(message);
        }
    }
}
```

# Backpressure

- Thread backpressure: read 1.000.000 rows from DB, a few at a time. Blocks when outgoing socket blocks.

- Aktor backpressure: none, needs protocol

- Streams!

---

# Introduction to akka streams

- GraphStage, Inlets, Outlets

- Source, Sink, Flow

---

# Some example sources

---

# Some example flow manipulators

---

# Some example sinks

---

# Comparison of the four models

- Futures and callbacks: can't be aborted
