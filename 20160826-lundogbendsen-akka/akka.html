# Akka and Concurrency Models



Jan Ypma
jyp@tradeshift.com

---

# Agenda

- Threads and locks


- Futures and callbacks


- Actor model


- Akka streams


- Akka HTTP

---

# Parallellism

- Actually run several units of work simultaneously

--

# Concurrency

- Logically run several units of work, seemingly in parallel

---

# Threads and mutexes

- *Thread* : logical thread of execution, scheduled by OS scheduler
- All threads share one memory space
- *Mutex* : _mutually exclusive_ flag that prevents threads from accessing shared resources

--

Advantages
- Close to how the hardware actually works
- The only model generally tought in school
- Blocking on I/O natually equivalent to "this, then this"

Disadvantages
- Expensive (~1M stack)
- Slow to create/destroy
- Deadlock

---

# Futures and callbacks

- Asynchronous operation returns an object that _eventually_ yields a result
  - Scala, Finagle, Q.js, ... : `Promise` / `Future`
  - Java 8: `CompletionStage<T>` / `CompletableFuture<T>`
- Can be chained, causing further processing (and further futures) after a stage 
  completes
- Can be merged, waiting for several futures' results before commencing 

```
CompletionStage<Done> =

http.request(GET("/tweets"))
    .thenApply(response -> response.getBody())
    .thenApply(body -> parseJSON(body))
    .thenCompose(tweets -> 
        http.request(PUT("/subscribe?topic=" + tweets.getMostPopular())))
    .thenApply(response -> Done.getInstance())
    .whenComplete((r,x) -> {
        if (x != null) {
            log.error("Well something went wrong", x);
        }
    });
```

---

# Futures and callbacks

Advantages
- Simple to grasp

Disadvantages
- only one value: no obvious way to stream data
- "callback hell"
- brittle error handling
- not (easily) cancellable
- still needs locking for shared resources (unless using a single thread)

---

# Cores and caches

- Latency Comparison Numbers

```text
L1 cache reference                           0.5 ns
Branch mispredict                            5   ns
L2 cache reference                           7   ns
Mutex lock/unlock                           25   ns
Main memory reference                      100   ns
Compress 1K bytes with Zippy             3,000   ns
*Context switch                          10,000   ns (if working set in L2)
Send 1K bytes over 1 Gbps network       10,000   ns
*Context switch                        >100,000   ns (bigger working set)
Read 4K randomly from SSD*             150,000   ns
Read 1 MB sequentially from memory     250,000   ns
Round trip within same datacenter      500,000   ns
Read 1 MB sequentially from SSD*     1,000,000   ns
Disk seek                           10,000,000   ns
Read 1 MB sequentially from disk    20,000,000   ns
Send packet CA->Netherlands->CA    150,000,000   ns
```
- Keep working on the same data for as long as possible

# The actor model

- *Actor* is an entity that responds only to messages by
  - sending messages to other actors
  - creating other, child, actors
  - adjusting its behaviour

- *Akka* is a toolkit for writing actors in Java
  - Actor is a normal Java class that extends `UntypedActor` or `AbstractActor`

- *Message* is an immutable, serializable, Java class

---

# Actor ping pong 

```java
public class PingActor extends AbstractActor {
    private int counter = 0;
    private ActorRef pongActor = getContext().actorOf(
        Props.create(PongActor.class), "pongActor");
    {
        receive(ReceiveBuilder
            .match(Initialize.class, msg -> {
                log.info("In PingActor - starting ping-pong");
                pongActor.tell("ping", getSelf());
            })
            .match(String.class, msg -> {
                log.info("In PingActor - received message: {}", message);
                counter += 1;
                if (counter == 3) {
                    getContext().system().shutdown();
                } else {
                    getSender().tell("ping", getSelf());
                }
            })
            .build());
    }
}
```

---

# Actor ping pong 

```java
public class PongActor extends UntypedActor {

    public void onReceive(Object message) {
        if (message instanceof String) {
            log.info("In PongActor - received message: {}", message);
            getSender().tell("pong", getSelf());
        } 
    }
}
```

# The actor model

Advantages
- Share-nothing approach comes natural 
- Straightforward unit testing
- Much more lightweight (100s of bytes) and performant (ForkJoinPool) than threads
- Trivially extends to a distributed system
- Ability to "just let it crash" in isolated areas

Disadvantages
- No obvious way to stream data

---
# Backpressure

- Imagine an HTTP request with a very long response, that reads 1.000.000 rows from a DB

*Using Threads*
--

- Just block while reading (waits for more data), and block while writing (TCP send buffer full)

*Using Actors*
- Let's have a "Request Actor" and a "Database Actor" 
  1. Request Actor messages Database Actor to requests the rows
  2. Database Actor sends back 1.000.000 messages as fast as it can?
--

- Needs some sort of `Ack` protocol between Request Actor and Database Actor, or batching

*Streams*
- What if we could combine the advantages of asynchronous messaging and add in backpressure?

---

# Introducing Akka Streams
- `Graph` is a blueprint for a closed, finite data processing network where various stages consume and produce typed stream elements
- `GraphStage<S extends Shape>` is one processing stage within a graph, taking elements in through zero or more *Inlets*, and emitting through *Outlets*
- It's completely up to the stage when and how to respond to arriving elements
- All built-in graph stages embrace _backpressure_ and _bounded processing_

#### Mostly used graph stages
- `Source<T,M>` has one outlet of type `T`
- `Sink<T,M>` has one inlet of type `T` 
- `Flow<A,B,M>` has one inlet of type `A` and one outlet of type `B`

#### Reactive streams
- Akka is a reactive streams implementation (just like `RxJava` and others)
- You typically don't interact in terms of _publisher_ and _subscriber_ directly

---

# Hello, streams

```
final ActorSystem system = ActorSystem.create("QuickStart");
final Materializer materializer = ActorMaterializer.create(system);

final Source<Integer, NotUsed> numbers = Source.range(1, 100);

final Sink<Integer, CompletionStage<Done>> print = 
    Sink.foreach(i -> System.out.println(i));

final CompletionStage<Done> done = numbers.runWith(print, materializer);
  
// Output: 
// 1
// 2
// ...
```

---

# Stream materialization

- _Graph_ is only a blueprint: nothing runs until it's given to a _materializer_, typically `ActorMaterializer`
- _GraphStage_ has input and output types, but also in a _materialized value_, typically called `M`
- Return type when the graph is actually ran
- Graph can be materialized more than once

---

# Reusable pieces

- `Source`, `Sink` and `Flow` are all normal, immutable objects, so they're ideal to be
   constructed in reusable factory methods:

```
public Sink<String, CompletionStage<IOResult>> lineSink(String filename) {
  Sink<ByteString,CompletionStage<IOResult>> file = 
      FileIO.toPath(Paths.get(filename);

  // Let's start with some strings. This gives us a Flow<String,String,NotUsed>
  return Flow.of(String.class)
  
  // Convert them into bytes (UTF-8), adding a newline
  // We now have a Flow<String,ByteString,NotUsed>
    .map(s -> ByteString.fromString(s + "\n"))
    
  // Send them into a file, and we want the IOResult of the
  // FileIO sink as materialized value of our own sink
    .toMat(file), Keep.right());
}

numbers.runWith(lineSink("numbers.txt"), materializer);
```

---
# Time-based processing

```
final Source<Integer, NotUsed> numbers = Source.range(1, 100000000);

final Sink<Integer, CompletionStage<Done>> print = 
    Sink.foreach(i -> System.out.println(i));

final CompletionStage<Done> done = numbers
    .throttle(1, Duration.create(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS), 1, ThrottleMode.shaping())
    .runWith(print, materializer);

```

- This does what you expect: print one message per second
- No `OutOfMemoryError`, akka buffers only as needed: _backpressure_
