# Akka and Concurrency Models



Jan Ypma

jyp@tradeshift.com

---

# Agenda

- Threads and locks


- Futures and callbacks


- Actor model


- Akka streams


- Akka HTTP

---

# Parallellism

- Actually run several units of work simultaneously

--

# Concurrency

- Logically run several units of work, seemingly in parallel

---

# Threads and mutexes

- **Thread** : logical thread of execution, scheduled by OS scheduler
- All threads share one memory space
- **Mutex** : _mutually exclusive_ flag that prevents threads from accessing shared resources

--

Advantages
- Close to how the hardware actually works
- The only model generally tought in school
- Blocking on I/O natually equivalent to "this, then this"

Disadvantages
- Expensive (~1M stack)
- Slow to create/destroy
- Deadlock

---

# Futures and callbacks

- **Future** is a handle to a calculation which _eventually_ yields a result
  - Scala, Finagle, Q.js, ... : _Future_ / _Promise_
  - Java 8: `CompletionStage<T>` / `CompletableFuture<T>`
- Can be chained, causing further processing (and further futures) after a stage 
  completes
- Can be merged, waiting for several futures' results before commencing 

```
CompletionStage<Done> =

http.request(GET("/tweets"))
    .thenApply(response -> response.getBody())
    .thenApply(body -> parseJSON(body))
    .thenCompose(tweets -> 
        http.request(PUT("/subscribe?topic=" + tweets.getMostPopular())))
    .thenApply(response -> Done.getInstance())
    .whenComplete((r,x) -> {
        if (x != null) {
            log.error("Well something went wrong", x);
        }
    });
```

---

# Futures and callbacks

Advantages
- Simple to grasp

Disadvantages
- only one value: no obvious way to stream data
- "callback hell"
- brittle error handling
- not (easily) cancellable
- still needs locking for shared resources (unless using a single thread)

---

# Cores and caches

- Latency Comparison Numbers

```text
L1 cache reference                           0.5 ns
Branch mispredict                            5   ns
L2 cache reference                           7   ns
Mutex lock/unlock                           25   ns
Main memory reference                      100   ns

*Context switch                          10,000   ns (if working set in L2)
Send 1K bytes over 1 Gbps network       10,000   ns
*Context switch                        >100,000   ns (bigger working set)
Read 4K randomly from SSD*             150,000   ns
Read 1 MB sequentially from memory     250,000   ns
Round trip within same datacenter      500,000   ns
Read 1 MB sequentially from SSD*     1,000,000   ns
Disk seek                           10,000,000   ns
Read 1 MB sequentially from disk    20,000,000   ns
Send packet CA->Netherlands->CA    150,000,000   ns
```
- Keep working on the same data for as long as possible

# The actor model

- **Actor** is an entity that responds only to messages by
  - sending messages to other actors
  - creating other, child, actors
  - adjusting its behaviour

- *Akka* is a toolkit for writing actors in Java
  - Actor is a normal Java class that extends `UntypedActor` or `AbstractActor`

- **Message** is an immutable, serializable, Java class

- Parent actor is the _supervisor_ of its child actors. On child actor failure, parent decides what to do:
  - Restart child
  - Stop child
  - Escalate

# Actor ping pong 

```java
public class PingActor extends AbstractActor {
    private int counter = 0;
    private ActorRef pongActor = getContext().actorOf(
        Props.create(PongActor.class), "pongActor");
    {
        receive(ReceiveBuilder
            .match(Initialize.class, msg -> {
                log.info("In PingActor - starting ping-pong");
                pongActor.tell("ping", getSelf());
            })
            .match(String.class, msg -> {
                log.info("In PingActor - received message: {}", message);
                counter += 1;
                if (counter == 3) {
                    getContext().system().shutdown();
                } else {
                    getSender().tell("ping", getSelf());
                }
            })
            .build());
    }
}
```

---

# Actor ping pong 

```java
public class PongActor extends UntypedActor {

    public void onReceive(Object message) {
        if (message instanceof String) {
            log.info("In PongActor - received message: {}", message);
            getSender().tell("pong", getSelf());
        } 
    }
}
```

---
# The actor model

Advantages
- Share-nothing approach comes natural 
- Straightforward unit testing
- Much more lightweight (100s of bytes) and performant (ForkJoinPool) than threads
- Trivially extends to a distributed system
- Ability to "just let it crash" in isolated areas

Disadvantages
- No obvious way to stream data

---
# Backpressure

- Imagine an HTTP request with a very long response, that reads 1.000.000 rows from a DB

*Using Threads*
--

- Just block while reading (waits for more data), and block while writing (TCP send buffer full)

*Using Actors*
- Let's have a "Request Actor" and a "Database Actor" 
  1. Request Actor messages Database Actor to requests the rows
  2. Database Actor sends back 1.000.000 messages as fast as it can?
--

- Needs some sort of `Ack` protocol between Request Actor and Database Actor, or batching

*Streams*
- What if we could combine the advantages of asynchronous messaging and add in backpressure?

---

# Introducing Akka Streams
- `Graph` is a *blueprint* for a closed, finite network of *stages*, which communicate by streaming elements
- `GraphStage<S extends Shape>` is one processing stage within a graph, taking elements in through zero or more *Inlets*, and emitting through *Outlets*
- It's completely up to the stage when and how to respond to arriving elements
- All built-in graph stages embrace _backpressure_ and _bounded processing_

#### Mostly used graph stages
- `Source<T，M>` has one outlet of type `T`
- `Sink<T，M>` has one inlet of type `T` 
- `Flow<A，B，M>` has one inlet of type `A` and one outlet of type `B`
- `RunnableGraph<M>` has no inlets or outlets

#### Reactive streams
- Akka is a reactive streams implementation (just like `RxJava` and others)
- You typically don't interact in terms of _publisher_ and _subscriber_ directly

---

# Hello, streams

```
final ActorSystem system = ActorSystem.create("QuickStart");
final Materializer materializer = ActorMaterializer.create(system);

final Source<Integer，NotUsed> numbers = Source.range(1, 100);

final Sink<Integer，CompletionStage<Done>> print = 
    Sink.foreach(i -> System.out.println(i));

final CompletionStage<Done> done = numbers.runWith(print, materializer);
  
// Output: 
// 1
// 2
// ...
```
---

# Stream materialization

- _Graph_ is only a blueprint: nothing runs until it's given to a _materializer_, typically `ActorMaterializer`
- All graph stages are generic in their materialized type `M`
- Graph can be materialized (`run`, `runWith`) more than once

```
class Source<T，M> {
  // A graph which materializes into the M2 of the sink (ignoring source's M)
  public RunnableGraph<M2> to(Sink<T,M2> sink);
  
  // Materializes, and returns the M of the sink (ignoring this source's M) 
  public <M2> M2 runWith(Sink<T，M2> sink, Materializer m) { ... }
  
  // A graph which materializes into the result of applying [combine] to 
  // this source's M and the sink's M2 
  public <M2, MR> RunnableGraph<MR> toMat(Sink<T,M2> sink, 
                                          Function2<M,M2,MR> combine);
}

class RunnableGraph<M> {
  public M run(Materializer m);
}
```


---

# Reusable pieces

- `Source`, `Sink` and `Flow` are all normal, immutable objects, so they're ideal to be
   constructed in reusable factory methods:

```
public Sink<String，CompletionStage<IOResult>> lineSink(String filename) {
  Sink<ByteString，CompletionStage<IOResult>> file = 
      FileIO.toPath(Paths.get(filename);

  // Let's start with some strings. This gives us a Flow<String，String，NotUsed>
  return Flow.of(String.class)
  
  // Convert them into bytes (UTF-8), adding a newline
  // We now have a Flow<String，ByteString，NotUsed>
    .map(s -> ByteString.fromString(s + "\n"))
    
  // Send them into a file, and we want the IOResult of the
  // FileIO sink as materialized value of our own sink
    .toMat(file), Keep.right());
}

numbers.runWith(lineSink("numbers.txt"), materializer);
```

---

# Time-based processing

```
final Source<Integer，NotUsed> numbers = Source.range(1, 100000000);

final Sink<Integer，CompletionStage<Done>> print = 
    Sink.foreach(i -> System.out.println(i));

final CompletionStage<Done> done = numbers
    .throttle(1, Duration.create(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS), 1, ThrottleMode.shaping())
    .runWith(print, materializer);

```

- This does what you expect: print one message per second
- No `OutOfMemoryError`, akka buffers only as needed: _backpressure_
---

# Example Sources
- Materialize as `ActorRef`

```
Source<T，ActorRef> s = Source.actorRef(10, OverflowStrategy.fail());
```

- Materialize as reactive `Subscriber<T>`

```
Source<T，Subscriber<T>> s = Source.asSubscriber();
```

- Read from a reactive `Publisher<T> p`

```
Source<T，NotUsed> s = Source.fromPublisher(p);
```

- Emit the same element regularly

```
Source<T，Cancellable> s = Source.tick(duration, duration, element);
```
---

# Example Sinks
- Send to `ActorRef`

```
Sink<T，NotUsed> s = Sink.actorRef(target, "done");
```

- Materialize as reactive `Publisher<T>`

```
Sink<T，Publisher<T>> s = Sink.asPublisher(WITH_FANOUT);
```

- Materialize into a `java.util.List` of all elements

```
Sink<T，List<T>> s = Sink.seq();
```

---

# Example source and flow operators
- Send `Source<String，M> src` to an additional `Sink<String> sink`

```
Source<String，M> s = src.alsoTo(sink);
```

- Process batches of concatenated strings, but only if coming in too fast

```
Source<String，M> s = src.batchWeighted(1000, s -> s.length(), 
                                        s -> s, (s1,s2) -> s1 + s2);
```

- Process 1 seconds' worth of elements at a time, but at most 100

```
Source<List<String>，M> s = src.groupedWithin(100, Duration.create(1, SECONDS));
```

- Invoke a `CompletionStage` for each element, and resume with the results in order

```
CompletionStage<Integer> process(String s) { ... }
Source<String，M> s = src.mapAsync(this::process);
```

# Akka HTTP (server)


```
final Route route = get(() ->
    path("/", () ->
        complete("Hello, world!") 
    )
);

final Flow<HttpRequest，HttpResponse，NotUsed> handler = 
    route.flow(system, materializer);
final CompletionStage<ServerBinding> binding = Http.get(system).bindAndHandle(
    handler, ConnectHttp.toHost("127.0.0.1", 8080), materializer);    
```

- `Route` contains asynchronous processing of an HTTP request
  - Delegates to nested inner routes
- Convertable to a `Flow<HttpRequest，HttpResponse>` in order to become a real HTTP server

---
# Directives

- The `get`, `path`, `complete` methods are called _directives_
- *Directive* is a method that returns a `Route`

```
/** Invokes the inner route if the request has GET as method */
public Route get(Supplier<Route> inner);

/** Invokes the inner route if the remaining path exactly is [p] */
public Route path(String p, Supplier<Route> inner);

/** Invokes the inner route if the first path segment is [segment] */
public Route pathPrefix(String segment, Supplier<Route> inner);

/** Invokes the function with the next path segment */
public Route pathPrefix(PathMatchers.segment(), Function<String，Route> inner);

/** Completes the request with 200 OK and the given body as UTF-8 */
public Route complete(String body);
```

- Invoking the directive method doesn't actually handle any HTTP requests (all directives are just factories for `Route` instances)

---
# Marshalling
- Unmarshalling a request body into a Jackson-annotated class

```
Route example = post(() -> 
  entity(Jackson.unmarshaller(Person.class), person ->
    complete("Hello, " + person.getName())
  )
);
```

- Marshalling a Jackson-annotated class into a response body

```
Route example = get(() -> 
  completeOK(thePerson, Jackson.marshaller())
);
```

---
# Query and path parameters
- Extracting several parameters for `?q=foo&q=bar&limit=100`

```
Route example = 
  parameterOptional(INTEGER, "limit", limit ->   // type Optional<Integer>
    parameterList("q", q ->                      // type List<String>
      complete("You gave q " + q + " and limit " + limit)
    )
  );
```

- Extracting a UUID path parameter for `/documents/{uuid}/summary`

```
Route example =
  pathPrefix("documents", () ->
    pathPrefix(UUIDSegment, uuid ->              // type UUID
      path("summary", () ->
        complete("You hit document " + uuid) 
      )
    ) 
  );
```
---

class: center, middle

# No annotations, no reflection, no AOP
# NO MAGIC!

---
# Other directives
- Complete route when a `CompletionStage f` succeeds

```
Route r = onSuccess(f, result -> complete("result was " + result));
```

- Handle incoming web socket request

```
Flow<Message,Message,NotUsed> handler = ...
Route r = handleWebSocketMessages(handler);
```
