# Event sourcing at scale

# Agenda

- A bit of Tradeshift history
  - Typical sources of failures
- Introduction to actors and akka
- Event sourcing
- Example use case: collaboration

---

# Tradeshift in 2011

.center[![Tradeshift system](tsold.svg)]

- Two major software components
  - _the frontend_
  - _the backend_
- &lt;10 developers

---

# Tradeshift in 2016

.center[![Tradeshift system](tsnew.svg)]

- 30 deployed components (and growing)
- 150 developers
- 250.000 LoC in _the backend_

---

# Scaling of Tradeshift's systems

- Moore's law applies to AWS 
- Single point of _not quite failing often enough_


- 2016 directive:

    _All new components must be clustered_

- Yeah, what about the 30-ish existing ones?
  - New architecture is needed
  
---

# Scaling of Tradehift's development process

- 2011: _"We're a Java shop"_
--

- 2016: Not really, at least not anymore
  - Groovy and grails
  - Python, go, ruby for infrastructure
  - Crazy javascript people
  - Scala 
- But still, mostly Java  
  
- Empower teams to pick their own language and frameworks

---

# Typical sources of failures

.center[![Tradeshift flow](tsflow.svg)]

- We're down!
  - We overloaded the database
  - which caused the backend to respond slowly
  - which caused the frontend to respond slowly
  - which caused our users' web browsers to respond slowly
  - which caused our users to reload their page
  - `GOTO 10`


--

- Enter the buzzwords
  - Let it crash [2003, Amstrong]
  - Micro-services [2005, Rodgers]
  - Self-contained systems [2015, [scs-architecture.org](http://scs-architecture.org)]

---

# Self-contained systems

.floatright[![Async comm](async.svg)]

- No outgoing calls while handling an incoming request
  - (except to our own databases)
  - All inter-service communication must be **asynchronous**
  - This implies data replication


- No single points of failure
  - System must be clustered
  
  
- Design must trivially scale to 10x expected load

---

# Event sourcing

.center[![Event sourcing](eventsource.svg)]

- System considers an append-only **Event journal** the only source of truth
- **Aggregate** is one unit of information to which (and only which) an event atomically applies
- Events  have a guaranteed order, but only within an aggregate

---

# Event sourcing

- Nice scalability properties
  - Each aggregate can process changes independently
- All information that spans >1 aggregate is materialized using *event listeners*

- Traditionally only applied inside a system 
  - Synchronous APIs only ("_get customer history_")
  
- Why not expose event stream itself?
  - Eventual consistency
  - Latency implications
  - Security implications

---

# The actor model

- **Actor** is an entity that responds only to messages by
  - sending messages to other actors
  - creating other, child, actors
  - adjusting its behaviour

- *Akka* is a toolkit for writing actors in Java
  - Actor is a normal Java class that extends `UntypedActor` or `AbstractActor`

- **Message** is an immutable, serializable, Java class

- Parent actor is the _supervisor_ of its child actors. On child actor failure, parent decides what to do:
  - Restart child
  - Stop child
  - Escalate
  
---

# Actor ping pong 

```
public class PongActor extends UntypedActor {

    public void onReceive(Object message) {
        if (message instanceof String) {
            System.out.println("In PongActor - received message: " + message);
            getSender().tell("pong", getSelf());
        } 
    }
}
```

---

# Actor ping pong 

```
public class Initialize {}
public class PingActor extends AbstractActor {
    private int counter = 0;
    private ActorRef pongActor = getContext().actorOf(
        Props.create(PongActor.class), "pongActor");
    {
        receive(ReceiveBuilder
            .match(Initialize.class, msg -> {
                System.out.println("In PingActor - starting ping-pong");
                pongActor.tell("ping", getSelf());
            })
            .match(String.class, msg -> {
                System.out.println("In PingActor - received message: " + message);
                counter += 1;
                if (counter == 3) {
                    getContext().system().shutdown();
                } else {
                    getSender().tell("ping", getSelf());
                }
            })
            .build());
    }
}
```

---

# Actor ping ping

```
public static void main() {
    ActorSystem system = ActorSystem.create();
    ActorRef pingActor = system.actorOf(Props.create(PingActor.class));
    PingActor.tell(new Initialize());
}
```

Output:
```
In PingActor - starting ping-pong
In PongActor - received message: ping
In PingActor - received message: pong
In PongActor - received message: ping
In PingActor - received message: pong
In PongActor - received message: ping
In PingActor - received message: pong
```

---

# Akka persistence

- Framework to do event sourcing using actors
- Persistence plugins for levelDB, cassandra, kafka, ...
- Each `PersistentActor` has a `String` identifier, under which events are stored

```j
public class ChatActor extends AbstractPersistentActor {
  private final List<String> messages = new ArrayList<>();
  
  @Override public String persistenceId() { return "67c67d28-4719-4bf9-bfe6-3944ed961a60"; }
  
  @Override public void receiveRecover(Object msg) {
    if (msg instanceof String) { messages.add((String)msg); }
  }
  
  @Override public void receiveCommand(Object msg) {
    if (msg.equals("/list")) {
      sender().tell(new ArrayList<>(messages));
    } else if (msg instanceof String) { 
      persist(msg, evt -> messages.add((String)msg));
    } 
  }
}
```

---

# Akka remoting and clustering

- Transparently lets actors communicate between systems
- `ActorRef` can point to a remote actor
- Messages must be serializable (using configurable mechanisms)

```
    akka {
      actor {
        provider = "akka.remote.RemoteActorRefProvider"
      }
      remote {
        enabled-transports = ["akka.remote.netty.tcp"]
        netty.tcp {
          hostname = "127.0.0.1"
          port = 2552
        }
      }
      cluster {
        seed-nodes = [
          "akka.tcp://ClusterSystem@127.0.0.1:2551",
          "akka.tcp://ClusterSystem@127.0.0.1:2552"]
      }
    }
```

---

# Akka cluster sharding

- Dynamically distributes a group of actors across an akka cluster
- `MessageExtractor` informs cluster sharding where a particular message should go

```
class ChatMessage { UUID conversation; String msg; }

class MyMessageExtractor implements MessageExtractor {
    private final int numberOfShards = 256;
    
    @Override public String entityId(Object command) {
        return ChatMessage.cast(command).conversation.toString();
    }

    @Override public String shardId(Object command) {
        return String.valueOf(entityId(command).hashCode() % numberOfShards);
    }
    
    @Override public Object entityMessage(Object command) {
        return ChatMessage.cast(command).msg;
    }
}

```

---

# Akka cluster sharding

- `ShardRegion` proxy sits between client and real (remote) persistent actor
- Persistent actor names will be their persistence id

```
public class ChatActor extends AbstractPersistentActor {
  // ...
  
  @Override public String persistenceId() { return getSelf().path().name(); }
}

ActorRef proxy = ClusterSharding.get(system).start(
            "conversations",
            Props.create(ChatActor.class),
            ClusterShardingSettings.create(system), 
            new MyMessageExtractor());

proxy.tell(new ChatMessage(
  UUID.fromString("67c67d28-4719-4bf9-bfe6-3944ed961a60"),
  "hello!"));
```

# Putting it all together

- 2015: Let's try it out first

- 2016: _Collaboration_ in production
  - Real-time text message exchange between employees
  - Text interface to automated travel agent
  
- In development: documents, FTP

- Stuff that works well for us: [https://github.com/Tradeshift/ts-reaktive/](https://github.com/Tradeshift/ts-reaktive/)
  - `ts-reaktive-actors`: Persistent actor base classes with reasonable defaults, and HTTP API for event journal
  - `ts-reaktive-marshal`: Non-blocking marshalling framework for akka streams
  - `ts-reaktive-replication`: Master-slave replication across data centers for persistent actors

---

# Stateful persistent actor 

```
AbstractStatefulPersistentActor
```

---

# Event journal over HTTP

TODO explain chunked stream

---

# Use case: collaboration

.center[![Collaboration architecture](collaboration.svg)]

- _Content_ backend has API to add messages to conversations
  - Messages go into the event journal
  - Journal is queryable over HTTP
- _Presentation_ backend listens to event stream
  - Materializes into views that are UI dependent
  - Can combine other sources as well
- Browser talks to both Presentation and Content backends
- Web socket stream informs browser of incoming messages
